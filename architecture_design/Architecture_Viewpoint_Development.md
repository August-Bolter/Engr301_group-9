### 4.2 Development



*An architecture description shall include exactly one architecture view for each architecture view point used.*

*Each architecture view shall adhere to the conventions of its governing architecture viewpoint.*

*Each architecture view shall include:*

*a) identifying and supplementary info as specified by the organisation and/or project;
b) identification of its governing viewpoint;
c) architecture models that address all of the concerns framed by its governing viewpoint and cover the
whole system from that viewpoint;
d) recording of any known issues within a view with respect to its governing viewpoint.
NOTE 1 See 5.2 NOTE for examples of identifying and supplementary information per a).
NOTE 2 The requirement per c) that each architecture view covers the whole system with respect to the concerns framed by its governing viewpoint is essential to the complete allocation of concerns within an architecture description. Within a view, one or more architecture models can be used to selectively present portions of the system to highlight points of interest, without violating this requirement (see 5.6).
NOTE 3 “Known issues” per d) include unresolved issues, exceptions and deviations from the conventions. Open issues can lead to decisions to be made. Exceptions and deviations can be documented as decision outcomes and rationale (per 5.8).
An architecture description may include information not part of any architecture view.
EXAMPLES Instances of information not part of any view are system overview, model correspondences and architecture rationale.*
