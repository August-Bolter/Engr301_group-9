### Regulatory 

The regulations our rocket needs to follow depends on the motor power range of the rocket.

Motor power range is determined by the minimum safe distance (in meters). 
Motor power range A-D can use the regulations as a guide, E-F need to follow the regulations and G+ need to follow additional regulations as well.

The regulations are specified in the NZ Rocket Association website (https://www.nzrocketry.org.nz/rocketry/rocket-safety).
It is ideal for our software to be flexible (to work with any rocket). Therefore, our software for the rocket should conform with regulations specified for motor power range G+ since if the software is suitable for G+ it will also be suitable for motor power ranges below G.

Hardware:
There are a few potential hardware limitations such as: 

*  The rocket not having internet at the launch site which could impair our software’s ability to get weather data.
*  The launch site could also be outside the range for GPS communication which would affect the rockets' GPS ability.
*  The rocket will be controlled in the air by gimballing the motors however, this will only work while the motor is burning
*  The accelerometer the rocket will use needs to be powered by a stable, constant current supply to reduce noise on the signal generated by it.
*  

Interfaces to other applications:
Delay on the USB serial (we will have to make sure our software accounts for this)

Control functions:
Our software is limited in the control we have over the rocket. We can dictate and determine whether it is possible for the rocket to launch but we can’t control the rocket once it is in flight.
