Regulatory: https://www.nzrocketry.org.nz/rocketry/rocket-safety
Depends on motor power range of rocket.

A-D only have to use regulations as a guide, E-F have to use regulations, G+ have to use regulations + additional regulations.

Hardware:
There are a few potential hardware limitations such as the rocket not having internet at the launch site which could impair our software’s ability to get weather data, delay on the USB serial (we will have to make sure our software accounts for this)…

Interfaces to other applications:

Control functions:
Our software is limited in the control we have over the rocket. We can dictate and determine whether it is possible for the rocket to launch but we can’t control the rocket once it is in flight.
