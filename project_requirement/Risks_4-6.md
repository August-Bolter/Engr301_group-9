#### Failure to agree on protocol with the Monte Carlo teams. 
##### Likelihood: High      Effect: High

Failure to agree on protocol with the Monte Carlo teams is a performance risk that would stop the project from integrating with them. It would be caused by a disagreement with all the Monte Carlo teams over how the two projects will communicate. An example is this project not wanting to send a piece of information the Monte Carlo team were expecting.

The impact of failing to agree on protocol with the Monte Carlo teams is being unable to simulate the rocket's launch. This would lead to the system being unable to determine if a launch is safe.

To avoid failing to agree on protocol with the Monte Carlo teams, the team will strive to:
- Be willing to make compromises on agreements. 
- Outline what the system can actually do.
- Don't accept impossible terms. 

#### Failure to agree on protocol with the avionics teams. 
##### Likelihood: High      Effect: High

Failure to agree on protocol with the avionics teams is a performance risk that would stop the project from integrating with them. It would be caused by a disagreement with all the avionics teams over how the two projects will communicate. An example is the avionics team wanting to send information that this project doesn't want to deal with.

The impact of failing to agree on protocol with the avionics teams is being unable to connect to the rocket. This would lead to the user not being able to control the rocket, or see information about the rocket's position. 

To avoid failing to agree on protocol with the avionics teams, the team will strive to:
- Be willing to make compromises on agreements.
- Outline what the system can actually do.
- Don't accept impossible terms.

#### Other teams fail to meet deadline. 
##### Likelihood: Low       Effect: High

The other teams failing to meet deadlines is a schedule risk that would halt the testing or development of the project. This risk would only happen if all of the six teams working on the Monte Carlo/avionics project are all behind schedule. 

The impact of the other teams failing to meet deadlines is that the project deadlines will have to be pushed back to accomondate them. This will cause the project to be completed later than expected, and the team will be waiting around for it to be completed. 

To avoid the other teams failing to meet deadlines, the team will strive to:
- Clearly express when a component from another team is needed.
- Check up regularly on the progress of the component.
