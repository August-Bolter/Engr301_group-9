#### Failure to meet deadlines. <br>
##### Likelihood: ?     Effect: low

Failure to meet deadlines is a schedule risk that can cause the project to run overtime. It is caused when an individual fails to take responsibility for their work and isn't able to complete what they had agreed to do. An example is when a team member agrees to take on some work that they didn't have the time to finish. 

The impact of a deadline being missed is that the other parts of the project will be behind schedule. These effects could make the project be completed later than expected or cause extra pressure on the the rest of the team to fix the individual's mistake.

To avoid failing to meet deadlines, each team member will strive to:
- Only take on the amount of work they can physically complete within the time limit.
- Be willing to help others when they are struggling with a task.
- Be willing to ask others for help when they are struggling with a task.
- Be honest about the amount of other work they have to complete.

To avoid a team member failing to meet deadlines, the team will strive to:
- Plan work around other obligations or deadlines. 

#### Major scope creep.<br>
##### Likelihood: Medium/Low    Effect: High

Major scope creep is a cost risk that can cause the project to run overtime. It is caused when extra tasks are added to the project scope during the project lifetime. An example is when another requirement is added to the project specification.

The impacts of major scope creep are extensions to the project lifetime or extra work to the team to fit into the same lifetime.

To avoid major scope creep, the team will strive to:
- Carefully define the project specifications so there is no room for confusion. 
- Focus on finishing the project requirements before adding extra functions.

#### Bad documentation.<br>
##### Likelihood: Medium/High   Effect: Medium/Low

Bad Docmentation is a performance risk that can cause bugs in the program. It is caused when an individual fails to properly document their methods or classes. An example is when a developer fails to properly add comments and JavaDocs to their method.

The impact of bad documentation is that the method is incorrectly used or that the code is confusing to developers who are editing it. These effects could lead to bugs in the program which will increase the work for developers and testers.

To avoid bad documentation, each team member will strive to:
- Write a JavaDoc comment for every method.
- Add important comments to their code so that it can be understood by other team mates.
- Make sure that documentation can be understood by outsiders.
