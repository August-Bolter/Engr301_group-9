##  3.2 Functions

4.   Go/No go function <br>

The system must have a go/no go function. This function will define the area that is acceptable for the rocket to land in. The system must turn the acceptable area, a tolerance and the probabilities of landing in the acceptable area into a go/no go signal. If the system produces the no go signal, the rocket will be blocked from lauching. The goal of the go/no go system is to minimize the risk of injury or damage to the equipment by preventing a launch from taking place if certain conditions are not met. The minimum viable product is comprised of this use case, among others.
 
  4A.   Define acceptable areas - to land in <br>
  4B.   Turning acceptable areas + tolerance + probabilties into yes/no (safe to launch) <br>
  4C.   Prelaunch check - NI <br>
  4D.   Launch check - NI <br>
