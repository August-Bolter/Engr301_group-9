1. How the team will manage computer-related risks?
    - Some risks were discussed in great detail in the section above (overwork, computer-use injuries, work loss due to technological problems).
    - Cable Management
        - Each team member will strive to keep their work station free of loose wires.
    - Security
        - No sensitive or personal data is stored or used by the program.
        - GitLab.ecs prevents people outside the university from accessing the online work.
    - Other risks
        - Up to team members to identify and mitigate depending on their unique situation.
        - Team members can ask for advice or help from other team members or the School Safety Officer.
        - Team members should share risks they've found with the team.

2. Whether project work requires work or testing at any external (off-campus) workplaces/sites.
   - The project is a control for a rocket, but can be tested at an internal site using simulations. Thus it won't require off-campus testing.
   - Note: it will require testing under field conditions (no wifi) but doesn't need to be in the field.
