NZ Rocketry Association (NZRA) 
The NZRA are a group of people who are interested in model rocketry and
build model rockets which are launched every year. They range from model rocketry that
leans more towards learning, safety and creativity, to advanced rocketry which includes
extreme speeds and a goal of heading for space.

The age range in the NZRA goes from Primary School kids to the elderly. They all have a
keen interest in developing rockets and expanding their knowledge about rocket science.

The NZRA have a National Launch Day every year where rockets ranging from small-scale homemade
ones to 6 meter factory built ones are launched. There are numerous videos of their launch days
on their website.

Our mission control software could be utilised in their national launch days, our "go no go" and "determine probable landing location" functions may prove to be helpful.
They have a similar set up to our project proposal, where a laptop controls an ejection charge under the rocket. They also do
numerous check such as "sky is clear, ranges are clear" before initaiting the countdown.

Considering the characteristics of our users, our Mission Control Software should have a simple user interface. 
Primary school students and the elderly are a part of our userbase, so having a simple user interface will allow the software to be usable by a larger audience. <br>
The software should also try to minimise the use of jargon. Not everyone will understand the technical terms that define aspects of software systems. 
As in, if there is invalid input from the user, instead of saying “That input has caused a NumberFormatException”, a helpful error message such as “The rocket length field only accepts numbers as input” is more informative and readable, especially to a non-technical audience.
