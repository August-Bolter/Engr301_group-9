## 1. Introduction

One page overall introduction including sections 1.1 and 1.2.

### Client

Our client is Andre Geldenhuis, and he can be contacted via the ecs mattermost, or via email at andre.geldenhuis@vuw.ac.nz.

### 1.1 Purpose

Andre has contracted us to create mission control software for a hobbby rocket launch, control, and recovery system. 

### 1.2 Scope

The Mission Control Software is a multirole software package that facilitates pre-launch, mid-launch, and post-launch activities.
It will identify favorable launch conditions, set the starting conditions for a rocket launch. 
During a launch it will monitor the rocket, reporting its status and position.
After the launch it will report the rockets position for manual recovery. 
This software will facilitate the goal of making hobby rocket launches safer for both the users and the community, as well as aiding in convenience tasks like recovery.

### 1.3 Product overview 
#### 1.3.1 Product perspective

Mention avionics and monte carlo.

Larger system is abstractly the process of launching the rocket, include identifying launch sites and actually managing the rocket after it's launched.

Mission control <--> avionics is over USB serial<br>
Mission control <--> "Simulation listeners"

Mention the on-site wind reading

Include details about the user interface, such as where the data from the rocket is shown.

One page defining the system's relationship to other related products

> **9.5.3 Product perspective** <br>
> Define the system's relationship to other related products. 
> 
> If the product is an element of a larger system, then relate the requirements of that larger system to the functionality of the product covered by the software requirements specification.
> 
> If the product is an element of a larger system, then identify the interfaces between the product covered by the software requirements specification and the larger system of which the product is an element. 
>
> A block diagram showing the major elements of the larger system, interconnections, and external interfaces can be helpful.
> 
> Describe how the software operates within the following constraints:  
a) System interfaces;  
b) User interfaces;  
c) Hardware interfaces;  
d) Software interfaces;  
e) Communications interfaces;  
f) Memory;  
g) Operations;  
h) Site adaptation requirements.
