### Usability Requirements

*  Entering the local weather data needs to be quick and easy to do. This is so that the go no-go function can calculate as quickly as possible whether it is safe for the rocket to launch.
*  When displaying the rockets' data, the units shown should be well known. This is to prevent the user from getting confused.
*  The rockets' software should work in areas without internet since it is not guaranteed that the launch site will have internet.
*  The software for the rocket should function correctly in different weather conditions (e.g. high wind, rain, snow)
*  If contact with the rocket is lost then the user should be notified immediately
*  The user should have a clear idea of where the rocket is (e.g. visualising the rockets' location to the user)
*  The suggested launch angle calculated must be a realistic and safe launch angle (e.g. suggested launch angle can't have a huge horizontal velocity)
*  The rockets' software should comply with regulations for any rocket. This is so that other people can use our software for their rockets.
*  Playing back the recorded file that holds the rockets details should be easy and quick to do since displaying the information quickly is critical.
*  Calculating the upwind trajectory should be reliable and accurate
*  Calculating the probable landing locations should be reliable and accurate.
*  The software should let the rocket know when launch is imminent as soon as possible
