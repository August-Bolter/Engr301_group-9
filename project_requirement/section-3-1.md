### 3.1 Stakeholders

See ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010 clause 5.3 and ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207 clause 6.4.4.3(2).
List stakeholders

The stakeholders for this project are the general Hobby Rocket Community (i.e The New Zealand Rocketry Association) and Andre Geldenhuis.

Stakeholder concerns:
Security - System Integrity, data breaches
Safety Hazards (i.e. while arming the ignition charge)

| **Stakeholder Concern**   |  **Effect Of Invalid Handling Of The Concern On The Stakeholder**  |
|---|---|
| System Integrity (Protection against unauthorised access)    | Unauthorised access could lead to unwanted rocket launches. Stakeholder could be held for ransom (the attacker could threaten to launch the rocket unless they get payment).Stakeholder trust in the developers will be diminished.   |
| Data Breaches  | To-Do  |
|  Safety Hazards (I.e while arming the ignition charge or incorrectly giving a GO for launch) | Serious injury can be caused and the developers will be held liable. Possible harm to bystanders can be caused as the rocket can travel far in high winds.   |
|Use of old/deprecated libraries |  | 
|Use of newly developed libraries |  | 
|Use of open source libraries |  | 


Talk about life cycle - availability, security, effectiveness, usability, interpoerability with existing systems.
Support - the supportability of the system
over its projected life‚Äêspan, obsolescence management), evolution of the software system
and its environment (e.g., adaptability, scalability, survivability), production (e.g.,
distribution, testability), and retirement (e.g., sensitive data eradication or retention).

For most systems this will be about 2 pages, including a table mapping concerns to stakeholder.
