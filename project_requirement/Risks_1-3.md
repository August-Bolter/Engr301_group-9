#### Sudden prolonged absence of a team member.
##### Likelihood: Low Effect: High.

The sudden prolonged absense of a team member is a schedule risk that can cause the project to run overtime. It is caused when a team member disappears for a long period without explanation. An example is if a team member is in a crash and is in a coma.

The impact of a sudden prolonged absense of a team member is that there is one less person working on the project. This means that that member's work would have to be split between the other team members and the project will take more time and effort to complete. 

To avoid the risks of a sudden prolonged absence, each team member will strive to:
- Offer an explanation if they are going to be absent.
- Add comments and notes into their work so it is easier for others to pick up.

To avoid the risks of a sudden prolonged absence of a team member, the team will strive to:
- Make sure each member knows about every different part of the project so they can start working on it.
- Have regular meetings with compulsory attendance to quickly notice a team member's absence.

#### Sudden temporary absence of a team member.
##### Likelihood: Medium/High Effect: Low

The sudden temporary absence of a team member is a schedule risk that could cause decisions to be delayed. It is caused when a team member fails to remember a meeting, and is contactable during the meeting. An example is when a team member schedules their work during the meeting, thus is busy and away from their device.

The impact of a sudden temporary absence of a team member is that a decision isn't able to be made. This will halt progress on the project, potentially pushing it back past the deadline. 

To avoid the risks of a sudden temporary absence, each team member will strive to:
- Check the communication channel at least once a day.
- Avoid booking commitments during the lab times.
- Be available on the communcation channel during lab times.

To avoid the risks of a sudden temporary absence of a team member, the team will strive to:
- Have regular meetings at the same time every week.
- Notify team members about meetings outside of normal scheduled meetings at least a day before the meeting.
- Keep important decisions to the normal scheduled meetings.

#### Loss of work due to technological problems.
##### Likelihood: Medium Effect: Low

Loss of work due to technological problems is a scheduling risk that could lead to the project not being finished on time. It is caused when a technological problem causes the file that was being worked on to be closed without saving the work. An example is when a blackout causes the desktop to shutdown before the file was saved. 

The impact of losing work due to technological problems is that work will have to be repeated. This might result in the final code being poorly written as the developer isn't thinking as hard about it. It will result in more work and time taken on the task. If the work lost is a lot, than it could delay the finishing of the project. 

To avoid losing work due to technological problems, each team member will strive to:
- Save their work regularly to keep an almost up-to-date version of their work.
- Work on all their work seriously, even if they are repeating it.
- Commit regularly to GitHub to protect against their device dying.

To avoid losing work due to technological problems, the team will strive to:
- Split tasks into smaller units so work done each 'task' is less.
