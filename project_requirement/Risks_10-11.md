#### Injuries due to overwork. <br>
##### Likelihood: Medium     Effect: Medium

Overwork is a physical risk that can, in unlikely circumstances, cause death. It is caused when an individual works for an extended amount of time without decent rest or food. An example is when a student pulls an all-nighter for multiple consecutive days to finish an assignment or study for a test. 

The more likely impacts of overwork, other than death, are sleeping disorders, anxiety, and a weakened immune system. These effects will reduce the work quality of the individual and potentially stop them from working on the project.

To avoid becoming overworked, each team member will strive to:
- Only take on the amount of work they can physically complete within the time limit.
- Be willing to help others when they are struggling with a task.
- Be willing to ask others for help when they are struggling with a task.
- Be honest about the other work they have to complete.

To avoid a team member becoming overworked, the team will strive to:
- Share the work between the team so no one's doing all the work.
- Be flexible with deadlines.
- Work around deadlines for other courses.

#### Computer-use related injuries.<br>
##### Likelihood: Low        Effect: High

Computer-use injuries are a physical risk that can lead to the individual not being able to use the computer. They are caused by continued use of a computer while using poor posture or repeating a similar action for a long period of time. Poor posture could be slouching, sitting straight upright, typing with a positive slope, looking down at the monitor or looking up at the monitor. 

The impacts often noticed of poor computer-use are back/neck pain, headaches, and arm pain. These effects could make the individual uncomfortable using the computer, thus reducing their speed or quantity, or making it too painful to use the computer at all.

To avoid a computer-use injury, each team member will strive to:
- Take regular breaks away from the computer during work to allow the body to stretch and relax.
- Stop working if something starts hurting and allow time for it to return to normal. If it doesn't, they should see a doctor.

To avoid a team member getting a computer-use injury, the team will strive to:
- Reduce length of online meetings.
