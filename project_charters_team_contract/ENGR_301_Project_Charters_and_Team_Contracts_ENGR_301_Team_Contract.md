# <center>Team Contract</center>

A Team Contract is a document prepared by each team prior to starting work on group projects. Students should be held accountable and responsible for their own actions. This contract provides an opportunity for your group to specify preferred methods of communication, action plans, meeting schedules, goals, and consequences of actions (or inactions) of group members.Â A Markdown copy is to be kept in the project's GitLab wiki during development of the Team Contract. A scan of a printed and signed copy is to be stored in GitLab when the team and staff agree to its content. For the Team Contract to be valid, it must be signed and dated.

### E. Consequences of breach of contract

Teams will conduct peer evaluation regarding adherence to the contract.

Teams cannot change any aspect of the team contract, particularly the "Procedures" section, once the signed contract has been turned in to me. Therefore, be VERY SPECIFIC on the Procedures section and spend some time thinking about this section. The only way changes will be accepted is if ALL members of the team sign and date a written amendment to the initial agreement.

If you believe that exceptional circumstances may prevent you from keeping the terms of the team contract, contact the Course Coordinator for advice as soon as possible.
